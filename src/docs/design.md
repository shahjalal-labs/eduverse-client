design philosophy
EduVerse follows a night-themed, glow-pulse infused, and developer-optimized design philosophy. The UI is built to feel futuristic, animated, and intuitively navigable, using technologies like Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI, Framer Motion, AOS (Animate on Scroll), and custom glow effects. The experience aims to balance aesthetic polish with practical UX — ensuring information is accessible, layouts are responsive, and all interactions feel alive with smooth transitions and hover feedback. The project uses React + TanStack Query with a fully modular architecture, and prioritizes privacy-respecting, CLI-first workflows (Neovim, Tmux, Hyprland). Pages and components are structured for scalability, reusability, and clean separation of concerns, while the UI conveys a confident, hacker-style vibe inspired by modern terminal UIs, blending tech appeal with user clarity. Every visual element has intention: from pulse-hover buttons to blurred glowing cards — nothing feels static or dull.
